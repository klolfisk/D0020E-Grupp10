D0020E, Autumn of '16
============================
Project in computer science, Group 10

This is a project for the course D0020E at Lule√• University of Technology.
The goal of the project is to make a web-based GUI for administering Docker containers.

The system should:
* Allow for administration of a docker session from a web interface.
* Be secure.
* TODO

We have chosen to not focus on the following features:
* Good looks.
* TODO
* TODO

Get started
-----------

1. Install Docker
2. Install Ruby on Rails
3. Enable Dockers remote API (like [this](https://www.ivankrizsan.se/2016/05/18/enabling-docker-remote-api-on-ubuntu-16-04/))
4. Clone this repository into Rails. The current working branch is `gui-skeleton`
5. Run `bundle install`.
6. Change the `Docker.url` line in the container controller of rails, to use the IP for your docker remote API. If you are running Docker on the same machine as rails, this will be `Docker.url = 'tcp://localhost:4243'`.
