D0021E
=======
This is a project for the course D0020E at Lule√• University of Technology.
The goal of the project is to make a web-based GUI for administering Docker containers.

The system should:
* Allow for administration of a docker session from a web interface.
* Be simple (both in implementation and usage).
* Be secure.

We have chosen to not focus on the following features:
* Good looks.
* Network configuration. This is a simple plug and play solution, locally. It will not set up a network tunnel for you.
* Large scale. This project is not intended for maintaining thousands of containers over thousands of servers, but rather tens of containers over tens of servers.
* Metrics. The project does not focus on tracking update, data congestion any kind of metrics. It should not be hard to implement som basic metrics but this is still out of the scope of this project.

Get started
-----------

1. Install Docker
2. Install Ruby on Rails
3. Enable Dockers remote API (like [this](https://www.ivankrizsan.se/2016/05/18/enabling-docker-remote-api-on-ubuntu-16-04/))
4. Clone this repository into Rails.
5. Run `bundle install` in the project folder.
6. Run `rails db:migrate` in the project folder.

Infrastructure
--------------

The following tools, frameworks, projects and libraries are (might be) used in this project:

* Repository
  - Github
* ~~Webserver~~
  - ~~Nginx~~
* ~~Database~~
  - ~~MongoDB~~
* CSS
  - Bootstrap
* ~~Javascript~~
  - ~~Angular.js~~

Git branch naming conventions
-----------------------------

### Standard branches

These two branches ~~will~~ should always exist and should only be written to by pull requests:

* `devel` will be merged to before every sprint demo, by pull request. All wip branches should be merged here when done.
* `master` will be merged to from `devel` after every working sprint demo and should always be a stable "release". Only merge from devel and maybe hot fixes if there are critical bugs. Only merging by reviewed pull requests.

### Work branches

These naming conventions should be used during active development.

* `wip/branch_name` these are work in progress branches and should generally have the same name as the corresponding scrum story. A `wip` branch should, when finished, be merged into `devel`

* `test/testing_something` should be used when you want to test something on a `wip` branch. If a test branch is successful it should be merged back into the `wip` branch it was branched out from. We generally don't push these branches to remote, unless there is a specific need to do so.

* `fix/#issuenumber_issuename` should be used to fix bugs. Remember to both file an issue in GitHub AND the icebox in Pivotal Tracker.
